A Firefox add-on that adds a button to the YouTube GUI, which redirects YouTube videos to Materialious (an Invidious fork) when activated. This add-on is useful for those who prefer the tools/privacy Invidious provides, but enjoy a sleek material GUI and YouTube's recommendation algorithm. This add-on uses the official Materialious instance, [app.materialio.us](app.materialio.us), as the redirect destination. 

## Features

- **Audio-Only Mode**: Functionally can be used as a **YouTube audio only player**. You can use the Audio Only feature Materialious provides, say you are listening to something on YouTube that you don't need video for. You can listen to podcasts on YouTube while playing a high demand video game and not feel the effects of a video player hogging your resources!
- **Simple**: One simple JS button in the bottomn right corner is all there is to this add-on. 
- **Lightweight**: All of the functional code is in the content.js file. Could be used as a ViolentMonkey script if you wanted to. Only 2.37 KBs!
