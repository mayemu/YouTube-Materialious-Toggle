Adds a button to the YouTube GUI, which redirects YouTube videos to Materialious (an Invidious fork). This add-on uses the official Materialious instance, [app.materialio.us](app.materialio.us). 

This add-on is useful for those who prefer the tools/privacy Invidious provides, but enjoy a sleek material GUI and YouTube's recommendation algorithm.  <br>Functionally can be used as a YouTube audio only player. You can use the Audio Only feature Materialious provides, say you are listening to something on YouTube that you don't need video for. You can listen to podcasts on YouTube while playing a high demand video game and not feel the effects of a video player hogging your resources!|
